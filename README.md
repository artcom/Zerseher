Deviewing effect developped
by Raphaël de Courville & Dimitar Ruszev

This effect was developped for the redesign of the Zehrseher, an interactive piece by Joachim Sauter & Dirk Lüsebrink originally created in 1991. The new version was shown at the exhibition “Vertigo Of Reality” at ADK (Berlin) in 2014.
