# Notes
The interactive part of the code has been modified to run as a standalone application, with the mouse cursor replacing the gaze-tracking of the real installation.

# Getting started
The visual effect used in the Zerseher is coded in Processing. To get it running on your computer, follow those simple steps:

1. Download the (Processing)[https://processing.org/ "processing.org"] environment
2. Open any of the .pde files included in Processing
3. Click on the "run" button or go to Sketch>Run

“Processing is a programming language and development environment aimed at students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists. Initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals within a visual context, Processing evolved into a development tool for professionals.”
